Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid privately told two journalists in 2008 that Obama was more electable because he's "light-skinned" and lacked a "Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one." While the media is abuzz about "sensational...racially tinged remarks." Over at The Root, I ask: <a href="http://bit.ly/4z3G9F">"Was Harry Reid Right?"</a>

<blockquote>Lost in all the handwringing and shock, however, is any clear explanation of what's wrong with Reid's comment. Clearly, using "Negro dialect" is about half-a-century behind the times, but does anyone think Reid meant ill by his anachronism?</blockquote>

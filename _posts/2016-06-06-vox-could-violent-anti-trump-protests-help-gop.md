Sparked by recent anti-Trump protests that escalated to violence, Matthew Yglesias  reviews recent research on the political consequences of violent protest and references my work:

<blockquote>Princeton professor Omar Wasow has a relevant paper that examined county-level voting patterns in the 1960s. What he found is that exposure to nonviolent protests pushed people to vote for the more liberal presidential candidate, while exposure to violent ones pushed people to vote for the more conservative candidate.

In today's <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/23/african-americans-still-proud-of-obama_n_934788.html">Huffington Post</a>, Rebecca Carroll looks at Pres. Obama's sagging support in the black community. I'm quoted toward the end:<p>
"At the heart of the debate is the absence of a clear black policy agenda for the post-civil rights era," says Omar Wasow, co-founder of BlackPlanet.com and a Ph.D candidate in African American Studies at Harvard University. "And, whether President Obama wins or loses in 2012, that debate is unlikely to be resolved any time soon."

Check out my article on The Root addressing how Obama became our <a href="http://www.theroot.com/views/first-internet-president">first internet President:</a>

<blockquote>Barack Obama is far more than the first black president; he is the first Internet president. Certainly, integrating the White House is the more historic accomplishment, but Obama's remarkable innovations in campaigning may have a longer-term impact. From this moment forward, ambitious candidates around the world will be trying to copy the successful, Web-based code of Obama's breakthrough campaign for change.

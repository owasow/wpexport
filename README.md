This repository contains a reference sheet `hypothesis-tests-reference.pdf`, which lists formulas you need to know for some classical hypothesis tests, and `intro-to-hypothesis-testing.pdf`, some lecture notes that I use when introducing students to testing for the first time. 

The reference sheet is a work in progress. For a test, here's the section on one-samples tests:

For two samples tests we currently have:

![two sample test reference](figures/screenshot2.png)

The reference sheet is mostly for my students to use, as the courses I TA don't require a textbook and they spend way too much time looking for these formulas.

Pull requests to add new tests or improve notation and formating are very welcome! Both pdf documents are compiled from the corresponding `*.Rmd` files.

### Caveat

Blasting students with this information is my least favorite way to teach hypothesis testing. If I had my way I would teach only the nonparametric bootstrap, or barring that, I'd follow Jonas Lindel√∏v's [tests as linear models approach](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/).
